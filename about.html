			<p class="bio">
				Pietro Groff, <br/>
				photographer raised in Italy and fled to Berlin to study photography at the 
				“Neue Schule fur Fotografie - Berlin”.
				Now living in between Berlin and Milan, shooting global campaigns through the 
				unique aesthetics that only the mix of these two cultures can give. 
				The underground-ish, rebel and punk-ish Berlin vibe meets the elegance and 
				the class typical of Milan. 
				His photography is rooted in coloured, dreamy and moody stories, where his 
				cinematic aesthetic gives them unique atmospheres. Human emotions and fluid 
				storytellings are what characterise more his personality and workflow. In love 
				with small antiques, mostly shoot art and fashion photography.
